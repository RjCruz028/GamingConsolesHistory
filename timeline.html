        <h1> The History of Video Game Consoles </h1>
        <h2> Generation 1 (1967 - 1975)</h2>
        <p> Before the era of Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft there were many offshoot game consoles that attempted to capture the hearts of gamers everywhere. This era was defined by arcade cabinets and simple home consoles that could only play games like PONG. </p>
        <div class="parralax-image" id="Odyssey" style="background-image: url('Odyssey.jpg');"></div>
        <h2> Generation 2 (1975 - 1980)</h2>
        <p> In generation 2 we see the emergence of the first big name gaming competitor with Nintendo's release of the "Nintendo Color TV Series". This generation was defined by simple single game consoles and still revolved around PONG sized games with household consoles being things like Mattel's Intellivision and Phillips Odyssey.</p>
        <div class="parralax-image" id="intellivision" style="background-image: url('intellivision.jpg');"></div>
        <h2> Generation 3 (1981 - 1985)</h2>
        <p> Generation 3 is the start of the golden age of gaming. This era was defined by iconic games such as Pac-man (1980), Mario Bros (1983), and the Legend of Zelda (1986) as well as many many others. We also saw the first true console war between the Sega Master System (1985) and the Nintendo Entertainment System (1983)</p>
        <div class="parralax-image" id="NES" style="background-image: url('NES.jpg');"></div>
        <h2> Generation 4 (1986 - 1993)</h2>
        <p> The war between Nintendo and Sega continued in generation 4 with the introduction of the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Meanwhile classic game companies such as Atari started to fade into obscurity and were eventually swept under the rug until nostalgia gamers revive them later in time. Handheld gaming also started picking up in this era with the introduction of the Nintendo Game Boy and Game Boy Color.</p>
        <div class="parralax-image" id="segamegadrive" style="background-image: url('segamegadrive.jpg');"></div>
        <h2> Generation 5 (1994 - 1997)</h2>
        <p> In this generation the war between Sega and Nintendo continued, however a new competitor also joined the race with the introduction of Sony's Playstation in 1994. The big 3 consoles of this generation were the Sega Saturn, the Nintendo 64, and the Sony Playstation. This generation was defined by the introduction of CD-drives with only Nintendo sticking to the cartidge based system, and at this time Sega started to decline rapidly in the ranks of game consoles. </p>
        <div class="parralax-image" id="PSX" style="background-image: url('PSX.jpg');"></div>
        <h2> Generation 6 (1998 - 2004)</h2>
        <p> Generation 6 introduced yet another competitor in the gaming scene with the introduction of the original XBox developed by Microsoft. This era started the landscape of competition that we still see in present day. Sega also released the DreamCast as a last ditch effort to compete in the console wars however by the end of the consoles lifecycles it was clear that the big 3 companies were Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft which had the Gamecube, Playstation 2, and XBox Respectively. At this point everyone was using disk drives and 3D environments in games became the norm.</p>
        <div class="parralax-image" id="Xbox" style="background-image: url('Xbox.jpg');"></div>
        <h2> Generation 7 (2005 - 2011)</h2>
        <p> The console war between the big 3 continued in this generation however the developments in consoles were anything but stagnent. While Sony and Microsoft focused on developing their graphics, engines and online play with the Playstation 2 and XBox; Nintendo focused on inovating the way we play games with the motion control centered Wii and the portable touch screen based Nintendo DS.</p>
        <div class="parralax-image" id="Wii" style="background-image: url('Wii.jpg');"></div>
        <h2> Generation 8 (2012 - Current)</h2>
        <p> This generation has given us more of war between Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. It started with the Playstation 4, Wii U, and the Xbox One with both the Playstation 4 and Xbox One showing quite a bit of success. The Wii U however ended up being quite a failure in hindsight but as the generation developed we saw the re-release of the Playstation 4 Pro, the Xbox One S and Nintendo's second attempt at this generation with the Nintendo Switch. It is also worth noting that throughout all of these generations PC gaming has been developing and competing the entire way. On the horizon there are many new technologies being developed including the Playstation 5, Xbox Series X, as well as many Virtual Reality technologies.</p>
